JavaScript Number Patterns and Operations

This project demonstrates various JavaScript number operations and pattern outputs using loops and conditional logic.

Features Basic arithmetic operations (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division). Number sequences: Numbers from 1 to 10. Odd numbers from 1 to 10. Numbers in reverse order. Custom pattern printing: Reverse numbers on both sides of a midpoint. Code Overview Arithmetic Operations Performs basic math operations using variables a and b.

Number Sequences For Loop prints numbers from 1 to 10. While Loop prints odd numbers from 1 to 10. Reverse Number Pattern Prints numbers in reverse order and in a mirrored pattern format.
